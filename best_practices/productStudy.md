# Product Study Best Practices  

## Introduction 
The objective of the Product study is the create 

## Pre-requsites 
1. Instructables account.
2. Basic understanding of Instructables page.
3. Must know the interface of Intructables page. 

**Note**: This whole guide assumes that you have the basic understanding of the interface of Instructables page.

To get familiar with instructables, 
1. Read this article,[Writing-an-Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/Writing-an-Instructable/)
2. Write a demo instructable blog.

## Steps to Write an Instructables blog

One can write upto 4 instructables blog in 8hrs with proper planning and batching. 

The steps given below can be batched to get optimum output.

#### Step 1: Write Heading & Introduction
Heading is the most important part of a blog.
Heading should be catchy, mysterious or clickbait to increase the views.

Introduction is a small summary of what the whole tutorial is all about.

#### Step 2: Writing the tutorial part of the blog
The Tutorial part of the blog can be copy and pasted. If you are writing the tutorial part, then the tutorial should have this flow.

1. Heading + Introduction + Supplies
2. Install shunya OS and Install shunya Interfaces
3. Introduction on GPIO or I2C or SPI etc, interface getting used
4. Connections / Building the circuit or connecting sensors
5. Introduction to shunya interfaces (introduce API)
6. Compiling code ( instructions on how to compile )
7. Running code (running instructions)

#### Tips for copy and paste
1. Copy and paste in instructables is weired.
2. If you copy and paste into the instructables editor then the editor removes one line after each sentence gets completed. 
3. This jumbles up the whole paragraph while copying and pasting.
4. The trick is to add extra line after each sentence so the when we paste, the paragraph does not jumble up.  

#### Step 3: Draw Fritzing Diagram
Fritzing is a software which can be used to draw awesome circuit diagrams, containing Raspberry Pi 3. It has many sensors, boards (RPI, arduino) pre-built into it, making it easier for us to create circuit diagrams.

to Download fritzing on Ubuntu 16.04 run command
```
sudo apt install fritzing
``` 

#### Step 4: Write Code for the instructable blog
If you are writing code form scratch for an instructable then you are doing it wrong. 

Pick code from examples in shunya interfaces and then modify it to your purpose.

Tips for this step:
1. Code should be well documented 
2. Code should compile with shunyaInterfaces 

#### Step 5: Connections & Taking Photos
For this step execute the below instructions in this order
1. Arrange the Board and sensors on the Table. 
2. Take photos of the arrangement.
3. Connect the sensors to the Raspberry Pi (board)
4. Take photos of the connections
5. Power on the Raspberry Pi 
6. Compile the written code (the code you wrote in the Step 4)
7. Run the code, Make sure it is running
8. Take photo of the output. (output can be on screen or can be on the sensor)

#### How to take good photos
1. Make sure there is a lot of sunlight while taking photos
2. If possible use a stand to take the photo
3. Re-arrange the sensors, boards or display instead of using camera zoom 


#### Step 6: Uploading photos
If you are batching each step you may have take a lot of photos for different blogs so make sure you arrange them correctly.

#### Step 7: Categories, License and Keywords
1. Select Categories as Circuits & Raspberry Pi.  
2. Select License as "General Public License"
3. Keywords are like #tags (hashtags in instragram) putting right keywords will make the blog show up first on google search. 
4. For keywords use google Adwords to generate correct keywords.
