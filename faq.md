**Question** : I have ordered the sensor and paid for it, but the status shows
that the sensor is not yet here. What is going on ?
> **Answer** :  We buy sensors every 15 days and it takes 3 days for the sensor to ship. So it may take a few more days to arrive, Please be patient.

> **Answer** :  The sensor porting team is on it but they might have been swamped with a lot of sensors, Please be patient.
